          CSE-E. Our mission is to streamline and simplify the process of
          managing student requests within educational institutions. Our project

        <h2 className="text-2xl"> Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s fast-paced academic environment, managing student requests
          can be a challenging and time-consuming task. Our vision is to create
          a centralized system that allows students to submit their requests
          easily and enables staff to process these requests efficiently.
          Whether it’s a request for academic records, application for leave, or
          any other administrative requirement, our system is designed to handle
          it all with ease.
